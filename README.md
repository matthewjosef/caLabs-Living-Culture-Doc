# caLabs-Living-Culture-Doc
This is the written (and evolving) document that attempts to capture and convey the purpose, mission, values and behaviors of the Collaborative Advantage community.

We believe that culture is merely the set of values and behaviors that the individuals within a community hold themselves and one another accountable to.

Law is merely the "written rules" of an organization, and is usually enforced via some threat (of violence, ostracism or otherwise).  

However, at the end of the day, words are not inherently self-enforcing.  They need to be interpreted by individuals and actually put into practice through the behaviors of those individuals.
As a result, culture trumps law.  

That said, law (the written word) can play a significant role in the shaping of culture and through that influence can result in real change on the ground.  This document is intended to be used in that way.  When our actions fail to align with our words, that should give us a hint that it is time to either a) change our actions or b) revise our "laws."

This is a living document.  

It is designed to reflect the culture and cultural aspirations of our organziation and our larger community.  It should serve as a guide to help us mutually steer toward the outcomes we seek.
